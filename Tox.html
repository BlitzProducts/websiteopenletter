I am a 14-year-old student from the UK. I&#39;ve been in the educational space since I was 3, classed myself as depressed since I was 8, and had suicidal ideation from the age of 10. Since I began my life in the educational space, I got bullied due to being a shy person. Therefore leading me to be always upset or depressed, from a young age. Then slowly over the years until 2014, I would become more depressed and still deal with these bullies, then go home and just be told to deal with it. I think it&#39;s fair for me to say I understand what having a mental health &quot;issue&quot; is like and what struggles schools bring upon us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Within this letter, I wish to discuss some problems that happen within schools and government entities, such as CAMHS (Child and adolescent mental health service).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.xiskwvnt6wu9"><span class="c1 c8">&middot; Subject 1: Schools:</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">It is not an uncommon occurrence that pupils get bullied at school, fortunately, due to what&#39;s happening in the world this year (2020, Global Pandemic) IRL (In Real Life) bullying has been minimal due to lockdowns and school closures. Sadly, this did not eradicate bullying and just moved it to cyberbullying, or temporarily stopped the bullying and waited for schools to restart, and then bullying restarted. With that said, schools still lack systems to help pupils with mental health or do not deal with mental health to the degree that it should be. I&#39;m not saying teachers and schools should try to be omniscient or omnipresent. They should at least try and help pupils more, even if that means just asking pupils how they can realistically help or how they want action to be taken against potential bullies or pupils causing mischief or violence towards another person. Here is an example of what does happen compared to what should happen:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.fpj9qsxd9n95"><span class="c7 c8">Scenario 1. Current:</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">James has been bullying Ashley for years. Ashley finally gets the courage to speak to her favourite teacher. So she tells them; they write it down and tell her they will pass it on to the Head of Year. She never heard back from the teachers about what happened yet the bullying continues.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.ifyibem16xph"><span class="c7 c8">Scenario 1. Changed:</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">James has been bullying Ashley for years. Ashley finally gets the courage to speak to her favourite teacher. So she tells them; they write it down and ask her what they think the punishment should be for this student, so Ashley gives a reasonable answer. Ashley hears back from the teachers about what&#39;s happened after a week. Luckily for her, the bullying begins to stop. She gets told if it doesn&#39;t she can go straight back to the teachers and they will escalate the punishment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.sc4sfdxs7ejw"><span class="c4">&middot; Subject 2: CAMHS:</span></h1><h2 class="c2" id="h.n84qzrwhudtk"><span class="c7">&middot;</span><span class="c12 c8">&nbsp;Description</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">For those who don&#39;t know, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is the name for NHS-provided services in the United Kingdom for children, generally, until school-leaving age, who are having difficulties with their emotional or behavioural well-being.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.53dd92tb17tm"><span class="c8 c12">&middot; Personal Experience</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c0">CAMHS have failed to assess or even realise peoples pain in the past, and personally, for me, they did nothing to help me, just told my school to apparently &quot;assess&quot; me for something, which never happened as it is. Secondly, during one phase of suicidal urges during secondary school, and after months of waiting, I got referred to them, and they said I didn&#39;t show any signs of threats, even though weeks later, I tried to kill myself two times in 5 days and at the time, I was a known risk. All they could recommend was taking up tasks I enjoyed and to talk about my mental health, which I was already doing but did not help. Therefore just leading me to never speak to anyone about my mental health.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.nl9pb6ftbq9k"><span class="c1">&middot;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Resolution?</span></h1><p class="c5"><span class="c0">There is no defined resolution to fix all of the problems I have stated.

My suggestions include:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Schools need to take mental health seriously, and all staff should take courses on how to deal with mental health cases and how to identify if someone is a risk.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Schools need to deal with situations such as bullying seriously and making an effort to stop it, rather than just getting a statement and leaving it at that.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The National Health Service (NHS) giving their department, CAMHS, more funding and more staff so they can correctly deal with mental health cases such as mine, and not taking way too long to even speak to us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The CAMHS risk assessment needs changes, so people undergo multiple tests before being denied or accepted into CAMHS since they have missed things with one test.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.bc7nhxbz3x0a"><span class="c4">&middot; Contact me:</span></h2><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c13">If you would like to contact me about anything related to this letter, please email me @ neonrichards@hotmail.com.</span></p></body></html>
